# Quotex Trading App: Real or Fake?

Quotex is a binary options platform that claims to be an "innovative
platform for smart investments" with the promise of easy profits
while "making online trading comfortable and safe".

## Is Quotex Real or Fake?

We believe that \*\*Quotex is not a safe or legitimate broker\*\* and
you should not open an account with them. Their trading platform,
trading tools, and service agreement are designed to make traders lose
money in the long run. Quotex is not regulated by any financial
authorities, so it is not a safe and legit broker and nobody is
protecting traders\' interests against shady, unfair business practices.

## 1. Not Regulated at All {#"not-regulated"}

Quotex is based in St. Kitts and Nevis where there is no regulatory
framework for online trading brokers. This means that Quotex is not
licensed and overseen by any financial authorities and does not offer
any form of investor protection, such as compensation funds, negative
balance protections, and client fund segregation.

## 2. It\'s Easy to Lose Money While Trading at Quotex {#"easy-to-lose-money"}

Quotex exclusively offers binary options trading, a high-risk,
high-reward trading type that makes trading very exciting, but also very
risky. It\'s very hard to be profitable at binary options trading, even
for experienced traders, because asset price movements are almost
unpredictable in such short timeframes.

## 3. Misleading Marketing Tactics and Trading Tools {#"misleading-marketing-tactics"}

Quotex uses misleading marketing tactics and questionable trading
practices that make potential traders believe that they can make easy
and guaranteed money on their platform.

### Trading Signals with 87% Accuracy {#"trading-signals"}

Quotex advertises that it provides trading signals with an 87% accuracy
rate, which is very unrealistic, especially in fixed time trading. The
broker does not provide any explanation of how these signals are
generated or verified.

### Shady Deposit Bonus Terms {#"shady-deposit-bonus-terms"}

Quotex offers promo codes and deposit bonuses to new traders, but hides
important conditions from them. According to the Quotex service
agreement, "\_these bonuses\_ \*\*\_are subject to specific
terms\_\*\* \_and conditions\_" and "funds credited as bonuses\_
\*\*\_are not directly withdrawable.\_\*\* \_When a client performs
trading operations,\_ \*\*\_the funds they deposited are used
first,\_\*\* \_and only after these are exhausted can the bonus funds be
utilized for further operations."\_

### Quotex "Guaranteed Winning" Strategies {#"quotex-guaranteed-winning-strategies"}

Quotex mainly became famous because of the hundreds of YouTube videos
discussing "secret trading tricks", "always winning
strategies", and "guaranteed profits", created by Quotex
affiliates.

## 4. Bad Reputation, Many Negative User Reviews {#"bad-reputation"}

Quotex receives many negative reviews about the difficulty in money
withdrawals, blocked trading accounts for made-up reasons, and bad
customer service from its users complaining on Reddit, Trustpilot, and
other credible review platforms.

## Trading Platform Overview

The Quotex trading platform has the usual clean, very intuitive
interface optimized for beginner traders, just like the platform of
other typical binary option brokers\'.
